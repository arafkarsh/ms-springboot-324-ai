     * This example illustrates the implementation of a more advanced RAG application
     * using a technique known as "re-ranking".
     * <p>
     * Frequently, not all results retrieved by {@link ContentRetriever} are truly relevant to the user query.
     * This is because, during the initial retrieval stage, it is often preferable to use faster
     * and more cost-effective models, particularly when dealing with a large volume of data.
     * The trade-off is that the retrieval quality may be lower.
     * Providing irrelevant information to the LLM can be costly and, in the worst case, lead to hallucinations.
     * Therefore, in the second stage, we can perform re-ranking of the results obtained in the first stage
     * and eliminate irrelevant results using a more advanced model (e.g., Cohere Rerank).
