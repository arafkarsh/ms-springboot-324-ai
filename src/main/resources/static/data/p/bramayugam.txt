“Bramayugam” is a canvas painted in the hues of black and white, yet it is in the subtle interplay of countless shades of grey where its true essence lies.

“Bramayugam — The Age of Madness” stands as a remarkable cinematic achievement, written and directed by Rahul Sadasivan. The period-appropriate dialogues, skillfully penned by T.D. Ramakrishnan seamlessly transports viewers to the 17th century.

Key Characters

At the heart of the story are three central characters (99% of the time):

The Feudal Landlord — as Kodumon Potti, portrayed by Mammootty.
The Cook (Kodumon Potti’s cook), played by Sidharth Bharathan.
The Folk Singer/Slave — as Thevan, depicted by Arjun Ashokan.
Technical Aspects

Director Rahul Sadasivan deserves praise for crafting this cinematic gem in captivating black and white. Shehnad Jalal’s cinematography and Christo Xavier’s music seamlessly blend into the narrative, immersing viewers in the historical landscape from the first five minutes of the film. The art (by Jotish Shankar) and costume design further enrich the visual experience, particularly in their manipulation of light and shadow to enhance the black-and-white aesthetic. The seamless editing of the film by Shafique Mohammed Ali harmoniously intertwines with the background score, particularly as it crescendos to its climax. The sound design by Jayadevan Chakkadath (and sound mixing by MR Rajakrishnan) significantly elevated the overall impact of the background score and the effectiveness of the dialogues, particularly those delivered by the Kudamon Potti, as well as the conversations between the cook and the folk singer.

Pillar boxing for a black and white film entails displaying the movie with black bars on the sides of the screen, maintaining the original aspect ratio of the film. Since black and white films typically have a consistent visual aesthetic without colour, the addition of black bars does not significantly alter the viewing experience in terms of colour reproduction.

Preservation of aspect ratio: Pillar boxing ensures that the black-and-white film is displayed in its original aspect ratio, preserving the director’s intended composition without cropping or distortion.
Visual consistency: The black bars on the sides of the screen blend seamlessly with the black-and-white imagery, maintaining visual consistency throughout the film.
Immersion and engagement: While the presence of black bars may initially be noticeable, viewers typically become accustomed to the pillar boxing and focus on the content of the film itself, particularly the narrative, cinematography, and performances.
Acting

Sidharth Bharathan and Arjun Ashokan deliver standout performances, fully embodying their characters’ complexities. Bharathan’s portrayal of the Cook’s disdain for the Feudal Lord and Ashokan’s gradual transformation from a meek slave to a courageous individual is particularly noteworthy.

And then there’s Mammootty, delivering a career-defining performance as the Feudal Landlord. His portrayal of Kudamon Potti surpasses even his acclaimed roles in films like “Vidheyan — Bhaskar Patel,” “Palerimanickam — Ahmad Haaji,” “Amaram — Achooty,” “Mathilukal — Basheer,” “Oru Vadakkan Veeragadha — Chandu,” and “In & As Ambedkar.” Witnessing Mammootty’s character transformation as Kudamon Potti is an experience that transcends words — it must be seen to be truly appreciated.

Micro Expressions, Voice Modulations

Micro expressions refer to brief, involuntary facial expressions that reveal a person’s true emotions, often lasting for just a fraction of a second. These expressions are believed to be universal across cultures and can provide insights into an individual’s thoughts and feelings, even when they are trying to conceal them.

One of the pioneers in utilizing micro expressions in acting is the renowned American actor Marlon Brando. Brando’s naturalistic approach to acting, particularly in his iconic role as Terry Malloy in “On the Waterfront” (1954), showcased his ability to convey complex emotions through subtle facial cues.

Several actors have since mastered the art of micro-expressions, adding depth and authenticity to their performances.

Robert De Niro — Known for his mastery of subtlety, De Niro demonstrates exceptional use of micro expressions in films such as “Taxi Driver” (1976), “Raging Bull” (1980), and “The Godfather Part II” (1974).
Daniel Day-Lewis — A method actor known for his immersive performances, Day-Lewis exhibits nuanced micro expressions in films like “There Will Be Blood” (2007), “Lincoln” (2012), and “Phantom Thread” (2017).
Joaquin Phoenix — Phoenix’s intense and immersive performances often feature compelling micro-expressions, notably in “Joker” (2019), “Her” (2013), and “The Master” (2012).
Meryl Streep — Renowned for her versatility, Streep adeptly employs micro expressions in various roles, notably in “Sophie’s Choice” (1982), “Kramer vs. Kramer” (1979), and “The Devil Wears Prada” (2006).
Mammootty is renowned for his exceptional skill in micro-expressions and voice modulation. In films like “Boothakanadi” (Malayalam) and “Peranbu” (Tamil), he demonstrates the concept of micro-expressions vividly in select scenes. Additionally, his mastery of voice modulation shines through in numerous movies, including those mentioned above in the acting section.

Mammootty’s mastery of micro expressions is prominently showcased throughout the movie, significantly enhancing its impact. The following scenes exemplify his adeptness at conveying subtle emotions through micro-expressions:

The introduction of the Folk Singer (Arjun Ashokan) to Kudamon Potti.
The subtle shifts in his expressions as the Folk Singer offers gratitude to God for the meal.
Mammootty’s nuanced expressions while Kudamon Potti indulges in his non-vegetarian feast.
The Theme of the movie

Certainly, the movie explores the concept of a loop, albeit in a distinct dimension. The final scene unequivocally solidifies the presence of a time loop within the narrative.

“Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,” originated as a profound observation in a letter penned by Lord Acton, an English historian from 1834 to 1902. Now, shifting gears to the concept of a loop, the final scene poignantly depicts the arrival of the Portuguese, symbolizing a recurring struggle for the average citizen in India. However, the context has evolved into an era of Electoral Autocracy spanning the globe.

In several instances throughout the film, the Feudal Lord, Kudamon Potti, consistently stifled the Cook’s attempts to voice himself freely, instilling a pervasive sense of fear.

This suppression was evident during the introduction of the Folk Singer to Kudamon Potti.
Similarly, at a non-vegetarian dinner gathering, the Feudal Lord’s domination over conversation was palpable as he curtailed the Cook’s opportunity to express himself openly.
The Sense of Entrapment

Many individuals find themselves ensnared in different facets of life: entangled in relationships, ensnared by their professions, or ensnared by the series of events that unfold in their lives. They may also feel trapped due to the political climate of their country. This movie subtly portrays this state of entrapment, revealing the stunning insight that once caught, escape becomes nearly impossible. Each character in the film is ensnared in their own circumstances, often unaware of their confinement. Yet, they possess an acute awareness that others may also be trapped in their current situations.

The cook inquires the Folk Singer whether he knows how long he has been residing in the mansion (Mana), to which the singer draws a blank, assuming it has only been a few days. This scene, along with other dialogues in the film, highlights the notion of being trapped without realizing it.

To illustrate the concept of entrapment, the film repeatedly features a black spider and its web. Initially, it may seem that the prey is ensnared in the web, but the reality is that even the spider itself is trapped within its own creation. This idea is underscored by a dialogue delivered by the Cook (Sidharth Bharathan) as he discusses the current state of affairs with the Folk Singer.

This adds another layer to the film’s connection to the contemporary world from a psychological standpoint: the depiction of individuals who are ensnared without awareness, or who are cognizant of their entrapment but unable to break free.

Conclusion

In essence, “Bramayugam” delves into the intricate dynamics between an autocratic ruler, oppressed citizens, and those yearning to rebel, portraying the timeless struggle between the privileged and the disenfranchised across various epochs and landscapes. Through a finely crafted screenplay, stunning artistry, captivating cinematography, evocative background score, and stellar performances by the central characters, the film transcends mere entertainment, offering an immersive cinematic journey that resonates deeply with its audience.

“Bramayugam” is a canvas painted in the hues of black and white, yet it is in the subtle interplay of countless shades of grey where its true essence lies.

Kudos to the producers (Chakravarthy Ramachandra, S. Sashikanth) for backing Director Rahul Sadasivan’s visionary approach.
