LJP’s “Malaikottai Vaalibhan” transcends mere cinematic storytelling; it’s a profound metaphorical journey, or perhaps an allegorical masterpiece. The phrase ‘കൺകണ്ടത് പൊയ്, കാണ പോകുന്നത് നിജം’ encapsulates its essence beautifully.

Visually captivating, with an enchanting background score, impeccable editing, meticulous art design, and stellar performances, LJP’s film stands out as a testament to his brilliance. Yet, despite its merits, social media buzzes with negative reviews, a perplexing revelation for me.

Each element, from characters to visuals and score, undergoes a meticulously crafted evolution mirroring societal development and the deepening complexity of human sins—the music crescendos alongside the narrative, mirroring the intensifying stakes.

Known for his intellectually stimulating creations, LJP once again delivers a masterclass. This film is a must-watch in theatres, akin to a sensory journey comparable to “Nanpakal Nerathu Mayakam.”

Now, a spoiler alert for the uninitiated.

The movie unfolds in five stages, each symbolizing a phase of societal evolution and the escalating depths of human frailty. The film progresses through five distinct stages, each reflecting the evolution of society and the deepening complexity of human sins as civilization advances. In addition to its breathtaking visuals, the film’s soundtrack undergoes a transformation, starting with a simplistic tone in stage one and growing more intricate with each societal development. Each stage highlights the protagonist’s triumph over a particular human flaw.

Stage 1 (First Fight — Arrogance):
The protagonist ventures into a humble village inhabited by simple, innocent folk, accompanied by his mentor and son.
His encounter with an arrogant adversary symbolizes the conquest of arrogance, a prevalent human sin. The accompanying background score and fight choreography remain uncomplicated, emphasizing the ease with which arrogance can be overcome.
2. Stage 2 (Second Fight — Cheating/Betrayal):

In the larger villages, deceit is lauded as a virtue. Despite attempts to deceive the protagonist, the antagonist is vanquished.
With each triumph, the protagonist’s following swells, mirroring the proliferation of religion alongside societal expansion.
The escalating prevalence of cheating and betrayal necessitates more intricate action choreography and score, illustrating the formidable task of purifying a society tainted by such vices.
3. Stage 3 (Third Fight — Slavery, Power, Greed):

Society reaches new heights of complexity, where slavery is normalized, and power and greed reign supreme. The protagonist emerges as a beacon of liberation, emancipating the oppressed and bestowing them dignity and freedom.
With each act of redemption, the protagonist garners more followers. The sins of slavery, power, and greed, deeply ingrained in the fabric of society, manifest in a dominant crimson hue. Red, synonymous with vigour and danger, underscores the arduous struggle to overcome these entrenched evils.
Here, the crescendo of effort is palpable in the soaring score, vivid visuals, and intricate choreography, epitomizing the character arcs of both the narrative and its cinematic elements.
4. Stage 4 (Fourth Fight: Inner Conflict — Jealousy, Suspicion, Murder):

In the sprawling expanse of society, jealousy and suspicion become commonplace, prompting individuals to conceal their true selves behind masks. Misunderstandings proliferate, eroding the fabric of trust and understanding. This era is bathed in the predominant hue of yellow.
Yellow, symbolizing happiness and positivity, casts a contrasting light on the pervasive negativity of jealousy, suspicion, and murder. Despite the veneer of cheerfulness, these sins persist, weaving a complex tapestry of societal discord.
The protagonist finds himself ensnared in a web of false accusations, bearing the burden of others’ transgressions. This plight echoes the trials of prophets in various religious narratives.
As society burgeons, so too does the shadow of evil, forever tainting innocence. These stages mirror a timeless pattern familiar from childhood teachings: the growth of religion, particularly within Abrahamic traditions, catalyzed by the emergence of prophetic figures.
Early on, the protagonist’s distinctive earring, a relic since birth, draws parallels to the legendary figure of Karna from the Mahabharata. Like Karna, he is born with divine protection, echoing the lineage of Surya, the sun god.
5. Stage 5 — Revelation:

The revelation unfolds, shedding light on the protagonist’s true origin — he is the Son of God, a being beyond the realm of mere mortals. Reflecting on the preceding stage, we witness the fate of this extraordinary figure, the progeny of the divine. This revelation draws striking parallels to narratives found in both Christianity and the Mahabharata.
In addition to the human characters, the film orchestrates a symphony of visual storytelling, employing colours, background score, and fight choreography to weave a narrative tapestry intricately connected to human frailties, societal progression, and the influence of religion.
In essence, the movie operates on two distinct layers. The first layer is readily apparent — the odyssey of a warrior embroiled in epic battles. However, beneath this surface lies a deeper stratum often overlooked, obscured by our reliance on visual stimuli.
In a nutshell, the movie has two layers — the first layer is evident.

The Journey of a Warrior.

The 2nd layer we miss, because we believe what we see.

‘കൺകണ്ടത് പൊയ്, കാണ പോകുന്നത് നിജം’ what meets the eye may not always reflect reality — a sentiment echoed in the multifaceted layers of this cinematic masterpiece.

Rating: 9.0 / 10
