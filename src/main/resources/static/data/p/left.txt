Why am I a LEFT?

Liberty
Equality 
Fraternity
Tolerance

The motto “Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité” emerged during the French Revolution (1789–1799). These ideals represented the revolution’s core principles, fighting against the absolute monarchy and its inherent inequality. They symbolized freedom from oppression, equal rights for all citizens, and solidarity among the people.

While not explicitly part of the official motto, Tolerance naturally aligns with the ideals of “Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité.” Accepting diverse viewpoints and beliefs is crucial for peaceful coexistence in a free and equal society.

Over time, “Left” became associated with progressive or liberal political ideologies, while “Right” came to represent conservative or traditionalist viewpoints. So, the term “Left” in politics was coined during the French Revolution, specifically during the seating arrangements in the National Assembly.

The following table shows how the concepts of LEFT are ingrained in American, British, French and Indian Constitutions.

French Revolution — 1789 to 1799


French Revolution
The French Revolution, spanning from 1789 to 1799, was a pivotal period in history that profoundly reshaped France and reverberated across the globe. It emerged from a complex interplay of social, economic, and political factors, with a cascade of events ultimately culminating in the overthrow of the absolute monarchy and the rise of republican governance.

The seeds of discontent were sown long before the revolution erupted. France in the late 18th century was burdened by deep-rooted inequalities and injustices. Society was rigidly stratified, with the nobility and clergy enjoying immense privilege and wealth, while the common people faced poverty, oppression, and heavy taxation. Economic crises, exacerbated by France’s involvement in costly wars, further strained the populace.

Amidst this backdrop of simmering discontent, several key incidents served as catalysts for revolutionary fervour.

The financial crisis was exacerbated by King Louis XVI’s extravagant spending and the burden of servicing the state’s massive debt-fueled resentment among the populace.
The calling of the Estates-General in 1789, a representative assembly comprising clergy, nobility, and commoners, marked a pivotal moment.
Frustrated by the monarchy’s attempts to maintain its power and privilege, the Third Estate, representing the commoners, declared itself the National Assembly and vowed to draft a constitution.
Bastille — July 14, 1789


The storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, symbolized the people’s defiance against tyranny and marked the beginning of widespread popular revolt. The revolutionaries, buoyed by their initial successes, embarked on a radical restructuring of French society. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen enshrined principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity, laying the groundwork for a new era of republican governance.

However, the revolution soon descended into chaos and violence as rival factions vied for control. The Reign of Terror, led by the radical Jacobins under Maximilien Robespierre, saw the execution of thousands deemed enemies of the revolution. The monarchy was abolished, and King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette were executed by guillotine, signalling the end of centuries of monarchical rule.


The aftermath of the revolution witnessed the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, whose military prowess and ambition led to the establishment of the French Consulate and, ultimately, the Napoleonic Empire. While the revolution succeeded in abolishing feudal privileges and laying the groundwork for modern democracy, its legacy was mixed. It inspired revolutionary movements around the world and advanced the cause of individual rights and freedoms, yet it also unleashed widespread bloodshed and political instability.

The French Revolution was a tumultuous period marked by profound social upheaval and political transformation. It represented the triumph of Enlightenment ideals and the struggle for liberty and equality, yet its legacy continues to provoke debate and reflection on the complexities of revolution and its aftermath.
